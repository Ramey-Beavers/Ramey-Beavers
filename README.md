### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ramey Beavers I am extra excited for this course because i feel it will be a more in depth teaching of python and other important skills for moving into industry and just life. Fun fact about me is I am a huge movie nerd, I watch atleast 2 movies almost everyday and if you ever want to talk about one let me know!
